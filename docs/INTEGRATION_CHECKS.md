- [ ] `/api/traccar/devices` returns device list
- [ ] `/api/traccar/positions` returns position data
- [ ] `/api/traccar/webhook` receives POST from Traccar server

- [ ] Shipment tracking data is accessible

### üß™ End-to-End Testing

#### WhatsApp Messaging Flow

- [ ] Verify message delivery
- [ ] Test webhook reception at `/api/webhook/whatsapp`

#### GPS Tracking Flow

- [ ] Device positions are being received
- [ ] Location data is being stored in database
- [ ] Real-time updates are working via Socket.IO

#### Database Operations

- [ ] CRUD operations work for all entities
- [ ] Tenant isolation is enforced
- [ ] Data persistence is working correctly

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Build Failures

- **Issue**: Missing environment variables during build
- **Solution**: Ensure all optional environment variables have defaults in `src/lib/env.ts`

#### Integration Status Shows False

- **Issue**: Environment variables not properly set in Vercel
- **Solution**: Double-check variable names and values in Vercel dashboard

#### API Calls Failing

- **Issue**: Credentials are incorrect or expired
- **Solution**: Verify credentials with service providers and update in Vercel

#### Webhook Not Receiving Data

- **Issue**: Webhook URL not properly configured in external services
- **Solution**: Update webhook URLs in Traccar/UltraMsg dashboards

### Verification Commands

```bash
# Check integration status
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/integrations/status

# Test WhatsApp send (replace with actual values)
curl -X POST https://your-app.vercel.app/api/whatsapp/send \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"to": "+1234567890", "body": "Test message"}'

# Test Traccar devices
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/traccar/devices
```

## Security Notes

- ‚úÖ Never commit real credentials to version control
- ‚úÖ Use Vercel's environment variables for production secrets
- ‚úÖ Rotate API keys regularly
- ‚úÖ Monitor webhook endpoints for unauthorized access
- ‚úÖ Use HTTPS for all webhook URLs

## Support Contacts

- **UltraMsg**: Check UltraMsg dashboard for API status
- **Traccar**: Verify Traccar server is running and accessible
- **Tive**: Contact Tive support for API issues
- **Database**: Check MySQL connection and permissions
