## Customization

### Adjustable Parameters

**In Code:**

- Rotation interval: Change `5000` ms in useEffect
- Progress estimation: Modify `estimatedDuration` (default 8 hours)
- Staleness thresholds: Update minute values (60, 120)
- Grid columns: Adjust Tailwind classes (xl:grid-cols-3, 2xl:grid-cols-4)

**Via Settings Panel:**

- Auto-refresh interval
- Fullscreen mode

## Best Practices

1. **For Large TVs (50"+):**
   - Enable fullscreen
   - Set auto-refresh to 30-60s
   - Ensure stable network connection
   - Mount at eye level in common area

2. **For Smaller Screens:**
   - Use windowed mode
   - Set shorter refresh interval (15-30s)
   - Position near workstation

3. **Network Considerations:**
   - Stable Wi-Fi or wired connection required
   - Monitor connection status indicator
   - WebSocket support needed for real-time updates

4. **Browser Compatibility:**
   - Chrome/Edge recommended for fullscreen API
   - Modern browsers (last 2 versions)
   - JavaScript enabled

## Troubleshooting

### No Data Showing

- Check internet connection
- Verify you're logged in
- Ensure manifests exist in system
- Check console for errors

### Connection Status "Offline"

- WebSocket connection failed
- Check network/firewall settings
- Verify Socket.IO server is running
- Auto-refresh will still work

### Information Not Rotating

- JavaScript may be disabled
- Check browser console
- Refresh the page

### Progress Bars Not Accurate

- Progress is estimated based on time
- Actual progress depends on business logic
- Can be customized in code

## Future Enhancements

Potential features to add:

- Configurable rotation speed
- Custom color themes
- Alarm sounds for critical alerts
- Map view integration
- Historical trends
- Customizable stat cards
- Multi-tenant view filtering
