Your production database is now configured and seeded with data.

## What Was Done

- Connected to PostgreSQL database at `db.prisma.io`
- Reset and migrated schema to production version
- All tables created successfully

### 2. Basic Data Seeded ✅

- **Tenant**: Digiwize
- **Admin User**: admin@digiwize.com (password: admin123)
- **3 Companies**: DELTA, RELOAD, TEST CLIENT
- **2 Routes**: Johannesburg to Cape Town, Durban to Port Elizabeth
- **2 Locations**: Johannesburg Depot, Cape Town Terminal

### 3. Sample Manifests Created ✅

  - 55906 - RELOAD CNMC/IXMTRACKING

## Access Your Production Data

Visit your deployed Vercel app and sign in:

- **URL**: https://dmoc.vercel.app
- **Email**: admin@digiwize.com
- **Password**: admin123

Navigate to `/dashboard/manifests` - you should see 5 manifests!

## Database Connection

Your production database is at:

```
postgres://...@db.prisma.io:5432/postgres
```

The `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is already set in Vercel.

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy your latest code to Vercel** to see the manifests:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Configure production database with manifest data"
   git push
   ```

2. **Verify manifests display** at https://dmoc.vercel.app/dashboard/manifests

3. **Import more data** (optional):
   - Use the existing import scripts to add more manifests
   - Or manually add manifests through the UI

## Troubleshooting

If manifests don't show after deployment:

1. Check Vercel logs for any errors
2. Verify `DATABASE_URL` is set in Vercel environment variables
3. Check browser console for any runtime errors
4. Ensure you're logged in as admin user
